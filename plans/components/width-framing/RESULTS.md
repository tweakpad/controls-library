# Width and centering cleanup

Baseline: `f5094b03`. Goal: simpler use cases that retain their behavior and demonstration, not pixel-equal framing or zero inline styles.

Reviewed 583 authored width/centering sites. Simplified 350 previews on 62 docs pages, removed 13 empty outer wrappers, and simplified 23 story sizing sites across 16 files. Existing component APIs and runtime code are unchanged.

## Decisions

- Use Preview width presets with `align="stretch"` for ordinary forms, cards, lists and inputs. Renderer-owned classes bound and center examples outside copied markup.
- Remove outer fixed/max widths, redundant `inline-size:100%`, and auto-centering that exist only to frame a sample.
- Preserve explicit scroll/overflow bounds, line-measurement widths, sizing comparisons, widget surfaces, popup content sizing and intrinsic calendars.
- Preserve nested geometry and other styling where it communicates the capability being demonstrated. Component geometry stays explicit; incidental framing uses documentation metadata only.
- Retain native semantics, content, IDs, values, scripts and named-slot ownership. Remove empty wrappers only when they have one child and no script dependency.

## Demo-only helpers

`<Preview width="5" ... />` uses a responsive 32rem frame. Renderers apply `demo-frame demo-w-5` outside the copyable snippet. No helper enters the core library stylesheet, component API or framework bindings. Storybook stories inherit the hero frame and may override it with `parameters: { demoWidth: '5' }`.

| Preset | Maximum width |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 16rem |
| 2 | 20rem |
| 3 | 24rem |
| 4 | 28rem |
| 5 | 32rem |
| 6 | 36rem |
| 7 | 44rem |
| 8 | 64rem |

Frames shrink to the available space. Omitting `width` preserves existing Preview alignment. The parser rejects invalid presets. Each renderer owns its stylesheet independently.
