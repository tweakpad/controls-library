# Plot performance and raster evidence

Measured through Chrome DevTools MCP, 2026-11-06. macOS, Chrome 156.0.0.0, CPU slowdown 1x,
320 x 100 CSS pixel monitor surfaces, DPR 2, one signed area series per monitor. Development fixture,
no builds/tests during the reported paint comparisons. These numbers measure synchronous Canvas
submission/geometry, not total GPU cost. The benchmark is opt-in; nothing polls on fixture load.

| Scenario | Mean per paint | Paint p95 | Mean batch | Batch p95 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 incremental, 1024 retained / 1023 visible intervals | 0.066 ms | 0.200 ms | 2.34 ms | 3.90 ms |
| 32 full redraw, same data | 0.196 ms | 0.300 ms | 6.40 ms | 10.30 ms |
| Same incremental scenario while Chrome traced | 0.052 ms | 0.200 ms | 1.80 ms | 3.00 ms |
| 32 incremental, sparse 120 intervals | 0.064 ms | 0.200 ms | 2.26 ms | 7.80 ms |
| 32 full, sparse 120 intervals | 0.053 ms | 0.100 ms | 1.76 ms | 2.50 ms |

Each stress batch paints every graph once per display frame for twenty frames. A real 10 Hz
shared scheduler spreads due jobs across frames within the budget; this stress test deliberately
bypasses that scheduler. A small sparse path can be cheaper to replay than to blit a canvas. Do not
promise incremental is faster in every workload. The dense example reduced batch CPU about 2.7x.

Isolated single-monitor twenty-paint runs recorded 0.30-0.35 ms mean, 0.50-0.60 ms p95. The initial
0.5 ms p95 target is not established by these short noisy runs. Longer intended-rate evidence is
recorded below when available. Increasing retention from 1024 to 16384 with the same 120 interval
window kept redrawn-column counters identical (826 columns across initial + 20 updates); geometry
does not traverse retained history on ordinary eligible updates.

Incremental warm state: one full paint plus twenty incremental paints; shifted 12 device pixels and
redrew 832 total columns (including initial 640). Full baseline: 21 full paints and 13440 columns.
The ordinary production path performs no pixel readback; readback belongs to this comparison fixture.

## Raster correctness

`raster-check.ts`, two overlapping signed/baseline areas with a dashed series, gaps, capacity 48,
window 24, 240 x 100 device pixels. Forty ordinary pushes after initial warmup, then peak/retraction:

| Interpolation | Wrap mean channel difference / 255 | Channels differing >24 | Full redraws during pushes/latest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| linear | 0.1435 | 0.0719% | 0 |
| step-before | 0.0086 | 0.0042% | 0 |
| step-after | 0.0150 | 0.0083% | 0 |

Latest replacement never shifted history. Reset caused one full rebase and zero pixel difference.
DPR 1.25, 425 x 133 device pixels: 216 ordinary pushes, capacity fixed at 256, no full redraws;
765 accumulated integer pixels. At final integer alignment mean difference 0.027/255, no channel
differed by more than 24. Fractional presentation can differ more from freshly rasterized geometry:
observed mean 0.984/255 and 1.785% channels >24 at a half-pixel position. This is an explicit
antialiasing boundary; backing pixels themselves only move by integers and are never repeatedly
resampled. At DPR 2 the original 40-update comparison stayed below 0.335/255 mean.

## Trace boundary

A Chrome performance trace was recorded for the dense incremental dashboard. The registered MCP
summary reports CLS 0 and normal ~16 ms frame spacing, but does not expose raster/composite/GC
duration totals in its returned insight set. Screenshot file export is denied for this workspace by the MCP
server. GPU time and allocation totals were not exposed in the returned trace summary and remain unverified; callback timing is not a substitute.

## Intended-rate follow-up

After removing redundant signed clipping for runs wholly above/below their baseline, 100 updates
at 10 Hz (after warmup) measured **0.335 ms mean, 0.500 ms p95** paint submission. One full initial
paint, then 100 incremental paints; 533 integer shifted pixels, 1585 total redrawn columns including
initial 640. This meets the planned single-monitor CPU target on this recorded run.

A real shared scheduler, 32 monitors, 1024 retained/1023 visible intervals, budget 1 ms/count 4,
60 display frames with producer writes every frame: aggregate paint callback work **0.793 ms/frame
mean, 1.300 ms p95**. 219 callbacks; every plot received 6-7 incremental paints and retained exactly
1024 raw samples. The per-plot 10 Hz rate is a cap; the budget fairly defers work rather than
promising ten paints per second. The wrapper measured the public scheduler job callback, not an
unrelated module prototype. No total GPU or GC timing claim follows from these CPU figures.

## Final raster comparison correction

The earlier raw differences above include a test-backend artifact: repeated pixel readback could
switch one Canvas to software rasterization while the comparison cache still contained GPU
pixels. The fixture now requests `willReadFrequently` on both test canvases before painting.
Production canvases retain their normal backend and never perform pixel readback. The full
baseline redraws all geometry on the same fractional pixel lattice as the cache; backing shifts
remain integer-only, with a two-pixel right guard. Dash reduction keeps original path phases.

Dense 1100 initial samples, capacity 2048, window 1024, 240 x 100 device pixels, forty pushes,
then latest peak/retraction, produced these stable same-backend results:

| Interpolation | Raw mean difference / 255 | Visible mean difference / 255 | Visible channels differing >24 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| linear | 0.0596 | 0.0323 | 0 |
| step-before | 0.0272 | 0.0223 | 0 |
| step-after | 0.0153 | 0.0169 | 0 |

Visible error uses the larger composited RGB error against black and white backgrounds, bounding
all opaque backgrounds. Ordinary pushes/latest changes caused zero full redraws; latest changes
shifted zero pixels. Reset caused one full rebase with zero difference. These results supersede
the earlier raster table; callback timing remains independent of total GPU cost.

## Final production-code timing repeat

With the final guard, decimation and presentation repairs, no concurrent build/test stage:

| Scenario | Mean | p95 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single monitor, 100 updates at 10 Hz, paint CPU | 0.293 ms | 0.600 ms |
| 32-monitor shared scheduler, aggregate CPU per display frame | 0.780 ms | 1.500 ms |
| 32 dense monitors, incremental batch CPU | 2.850 ms | 10.700 ms |
| 32 dense monitors, full redraw batch CPU | 7.690 ms | 10.600 ms |

The dense mean reduction remains 2.7x; the short batch p95 is noisy and showed no improvement.
The single-monitor 0.5 ms p95 target was not met in this final repeat; the earlier 0.5 ms result
is not a guarantee. The scheduler executed 200 callbacks, fairly distributing 5-6 incremental
paints per plot across 60 frames, with every history bounded to 1024 samples. All 100 ordinary
single-monitor updates were incremental (one initial full paint); no latest revision shifted
pixels. The final dense raster repeat reproduced the corrected table above exactly.

## Smooth clock scrolling and raster-atlas optimization (2026-11-06)

The first live hero originally collected and painted at 10 Hz, visibly jumping several pixels
per update. It now collects explicit timestamps at 10 Hz and follows a continuous clock at up to
60 Hz. It displays one sample (100 ms) behind collection so both endpoints of the segment at the
right edge are known. It never extrapolates or invents observations. Hidden collection is skipped;
teardown disposes the bounded 256-sample stream. Push/latest behavior is unchanged.

Scheduler repairs request the animation frame ahead of its deadline, carry the target rate phase
through normal refresh jitter and skip missed periods without catch-up bursts. The element and
scheduler use the same timestamp/deadline helper. Deterministic regressions cover jitter, 120 Hz
and non-multiple 75 Hz displays. Clock paints reuse previous retention boundary maps between
source revisions and numeric mapping comparisons replace per-frame string keys.

The element's eligible cache now has two viewport widths. Integer motion advances its source
rectangle, dirty columns draw into translated atlas coordinates, and one overlapping copy compacts
it only when the viewport reaches the buffer end. Fractional presentation is one cropped image
with the original guard pixels, avoiding wrap seams. Extra memory is one device-pixel viewport
(approximately width x height x 4 bytes), independent of retained sample count. Solid backgrounds
fill directly instead of compositing a cached background image.

Actual automatic live-hero callbacks, 1592 x 192 CSS pixels, DPR 2, no concurrent tests/builds,
matched three-second A/B with the same pacing and samples:

| Cache | Paint CPU mean | Paint CPU p95 | Automatic paints | Full history self-copies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linear viewport shifted each frame | 0.339 ms | 0.500 ms | 180 | 180 |
| Sliding raster atlas | 0.312 ms | 0.400 ms | 180 | 0 |

Both delivered 16.666 ms mean intervals, 17.7 ms p95. Mean CPU improved about 8%; p95 improved
about 20%. The strong structural gain is removal of repeated full-history copies; GPU totals
are not available, so no GPU percentage is claimed. The initial uncontended 10 Hz hero measured
0.383 ms mean/0.600 p95, but its lower paint frequency is not an equal-work A/B comparison.

At a verified 320 x 100 CSS pixels/DPR 2, the automatic clock hero delivered 180 paints/30 samples
in three seconds, 0.273 ms mean and 0.400 ms p95, 16.667 ms mean cadence, and zero ordinary full
redraws. A 32-monitor budgeted 10 Hz dashboard delivered 229 callbacks across 60 frames, fair
6-7 paints per monitor, mean aggregate 0.647 ms/frame and 1.200 ms p95; every stream retained 1024.

Atlas raster comparisons covered 400 sparse pushes (many compactions), dense decimation, signed
fills, gaps, dashed and step paths, latest revisions and reset. Their error levels match the old
cache; reset difference is zero. The actual element's clock-vs-full check replayed 30 seconds of
timestamps across retention wrap and multiple compactions: 240 incremental paints versus 241
full paints, 256 retained samples, largest checkpoint mean difference 0.000922/255. Local JSON
records are under tmp/component-verification/plot/smooth-scroll/. These browser readback checks
are separate from performance timing and do not add readback to production.

A live Chrome trace returned CLS 0 and no further insight sets. Exporting the raw trace to the
local tmp path was denied by the MCP server's workspace policy; total GPU and GC timings remain
unverified. The background full regression run was terminated when the user raised contention;
only focused changed-area regressions are used for this follow-up.
