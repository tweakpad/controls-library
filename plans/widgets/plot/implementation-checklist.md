## Early integration checkpoint

| ID | Check | Status | Evidence / unresolved finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I-01 | Shared ownership and actual integration | passed | Actual diff uses CanvasSurface, windowFrames, shared visualization content and recipe. Chrome fixture paints without template updates on stream ingestion. |
| I-02 | First rendered signed history matches presentation source | passed | Chrome MCP page 56: signed colored area and bare waveform inspected; semantic palette and shared chart metadata treatment. Canvas 680x212 device pixels. |
| I-03 | Push, latest, fill/line and decorations independent | passed | Chrome MCP: 40 pushes kept fullRedraws=2; incrementalPaints 4 to 44, redrawnColumns 1387 to 1774, 227 shifted pixels. Latest peak and retraction shifted no pixels. Full comparison mean 0 at integer alignment, <=0.335/255 fractional, <=0.48% channels differ >24. Fill, sign and optional background independent. |

## Gate record

| Gate | Status | Required exit evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Sources and scope | passed | Fresh contract e2b945d3, full plan capability/source/reuse mapping above. |
| 1. Capability mapping | passed | Fresh contract e2b945d3, full plan capability/source/reuse mapping above. |
| 2. Architecture and composition reuse | passed | Fresh contract e2b945d3, full plan capability/source/reuse mapping above. |
| 3. Behavior | blocked | C-01 to C-18 behavior observed; actual hidden-document and native GPU-loss verification unavailable (C-12). |
| 4. Presentation and customization | passed | Light/dark, RTL, live dictionary/part hooks and palette inheritance observed; final shared subscription unit passes. |
| 5. Accessibility | passed | Real keyboard/pointer inspection, captions and AX tree, axe zero violations; C-14/C-15. |
| 6. Visual and interaction inspection | passed | Signed overlapping areas, waveforms, axes, guides, fractional DPR raster comparisons and real input observed; C-05 to C-09 and C-14. |
| 7. Documentation and demo reuse | passed | Shared page checker (20 tests + page), 96 docs, both static renderings read in Chrome; all six previews and actual Buttons work. |
| 8. Regression and reconciliation | blocked | 441 files / 6241 unit tests passed, 3 skipped; final focused 31 passed; all types, ESLint/Stylelint, formatting, package/size/tree-shaking and framework ledgers pass. C-12/C-20 actual-environment measurements remain open. |

## Verification boundary

The requested implementation remains the full approved scope. Tool-limited measurements are not a
reduced feature release: actual hidden-document suspension and native GPU context-loss recovery
cannot be claimed from the current Chrome session (every tested tab remained visible); the
Foundation handler paths have deterministic unit evidence. The returned trace insight set did not
supply total GPU/raster/composite/GC durations. Those parts of C-12/C-20 remain blocked; no complete
conformance claim is made. Screenshot file export was denied by the MCP server; screenshots were
inspected inline. Local logs and the isolated website copy do not ship with the package.

## Final shared appearance repair

PresentationController now exposes a cached-renderer subscription. It notifies only when a
resolved recipe or an owned terminal hook changes, avoiding template-driven history rebases.
Plot releases the subscription on disconnect/scheduler replacement. The native color probe lives
inside the surface so part-scoped palette roles inherit correctly. Legend marks update directly
from resolved paint colors without a telemetry-triggered Lit update.
Chrome dictionary replacement changed surface to #123456 and palette marks to rgb(171,205,239),
with one full history rebase. Existing presentation update/hook unit coverage also runs.

## Final regression summary

- Full unit suite: 441 files passed, 6241 tests passed, 3 skipped, 160.30 s; one worker.
- Final focused Plot/presentation rerun after the SSR type correction: 5 files, 31 tests passed.
- Final library TypeScript and React/Vue/Preact/Solid/Svelte compilers pass; Svelte zero warnings.
- Focused ESLint/Stylelint and repository formatting pass; generated bindings report zero stale files.
- Build, 97-bundle size report and tree-shaking budgets pass; pack smoke passes including Node SSR.
- Plot independent consumer bundle: 80,992 uncompressed bytes / 25,806 gzip bytes, not a sum of compressed modules.
- React/Vue source and built props/event + isolated smoke passed, index 154/204 with no diagnostics.
- Isolated site: 116 built pages, 96 shared docs; final Plot page has six working full-width previews,
  generated API descriptions, correct Keyboard order, no raw frontmatter or native table chrome.
- Static Storybook: six working previews, generated API, no Related; only missing favicon request,
  no component runtime errors. Numeric stroke control step corrected to 0.5.
- Tests/builds ran sequentially at low priority with bounded heaps, no owned user server stopped.

The complete gate checker intentionally remains blocked by the explicit C-12/C-20 measurement
boundaries above. Implementation and verification-stage record checks pass; full conformance is
not asserted. The final CPU p95 repeat (0.6 ms single monitor) is recorded against the 0.5 ms target.

Final static rebuild verified stroke input value 1.5 with step 0.5 and no invalid controls.
Focusing the Storybook axes switch and pressing real Space changed the hero's xAxis/yAxis to
independent axis configurations while preserving all 240 data points. Temporary verification tab
and servers on 5391/5392/5393 were closed; existing user Storybook on 6006 was preserved.
